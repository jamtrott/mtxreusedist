#
# Usage:
#
# First, download the matrix HB/1138_bus from the SuiteSparse Matrix
# Collection at https://sparse.tamu.edu/HB/1138_bus.
#
# Next, run the command:
#
#   ./mtxreusedist --histogram --line-size=32 --verbose 1138_bus.mtx >1138_bus.txt
#
# Finally, plot the histogram:
#
#   gnuplot 1138_bus.gnu
#
